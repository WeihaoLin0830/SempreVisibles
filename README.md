# AirQualityMap: High-Resolution Air Quality Forecasting for Catalonia

## üèÜ BSC Challenge Winners - BitsxLaMarat√≥ Hackathon

AirQualityMap is an air quality prediction system that downscales regional pollution data to street-level resolution across Catalonia, developed for the "Fem visible l'invisible!" challenge by Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

## Project Overview

AirQualityMap transforms low-resolution (1km√ó1km) air quality predictions from the CALIOPE system into highly detailed street-level pollution maps. By combining advanced spatial interpolation techniques with machine learning models that incorporate traffic patterns and local measurements, we provide citizens with accurate, hyper-local air quality forecasts.

## Technical Approach

### Data Sources Integration
- **CALIOPE System Data**: 1km√ó1km resolution NO‚ÇÇ pollution predictions across Catalonia
- **XVPCA Stations**: Ground-truth air quality measurements from land monitoring stations
- **Traffic Patterns**: Road network data with traffic intensity information
- **Temporal Factors**: Historical patterns of pollution variation by hour and day

### Modeling Pipeline

#### 1. Spatial Interpolation
- Implemented **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** to create a baseline high-resolution pollution map
- Interpolated values from CALIOPE grid points to target prediction areas
- Applied distance-decay functions to weight the influence of nearby measurement points

#### 2. Road-based Refinement Model
- Extracted features from road networks near air quality stations
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** to adjust pollution estimates based on:
  - Road width and type
  - Traffic intensity
  - Distance to major pollution sources
- Performed feature importance analysis to identify key pollution predictors

#### 3. Temporal Adjustment Layer
- Trained a **LightGBM** model to account for:
  - Hourly pollution variations (rush hour patterns)
  - Daily patterns (weekday vs. weekend differences)
  - Seasonal trends
- Created adjustment factors to modify base predictions according to specific forecast times

#### 4. Model Validation
- Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure prediction accuracy
- Validated against held-out XVPCA station data
- Optimized hyperparameters for both spatial and temporal components

### Web Application Development
- Created an intuitive interface for accessing high-resolution pollution maps
- Implemented city selection for major Catalan urban areas
- Developed interactive visualization of pollution levels with color-coded indicators
- Enabled time-based forecasting capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Random Forest Regressors
- **Geospatial Analysis**: PostGIS, QGIS

- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

### Key Achievements
- Successfully downscaled 1km¬≤ resolution data to street-level detail
- Created an accurate predictive model despite limited training data
- Developed a system capable of real-time air quality forecasting
- Produced intuitive visualizations that make pollution patterns easily understandable for citizens
